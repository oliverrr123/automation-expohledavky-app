# .cursorrules for exreceivables.com Next.js Project

# Project Overview
# This is a Next.js project for exreceivables.com, operating in 4 countries with domains:
# - expohledavky.cz (Czech)
# - expohladavky.sk (Slovak)
# - exforderungen.de (German)
# - exreceivables.com (English, UK)
# All sites share one repo, with translations in locales/ folder and localized routes.

# Translation System
# Translations are stored in JSON files in the locales/ folder (e.g., cs.json, sk.json, de.json, en.json).
# Pages use i18n to fetch translations dynamically based on the site's language.
# Example: For a Czech page, only use locales/cs.json; for English, only use locales/en.json.

# Localized Routing
# Routes are language-specific:
# - Czech: /o-nas, /kontakt, etc.
# - Slovak: /o-nas, /kontakt, etc.
# - German: /uber-uns, /kontakt, etc.
# - English: /about-us, /contact, etc.
# When suggesting route names or links, match the language of the target domain.

# SEO Optimization
# Each domain must only render content in its designated language:
# - expohledavky.cz: Czech only
# - expohladavky.sk: Slovak only
# - exforderungen.de: German only
# - exreceivables.com: English only
# Avoid mixing languages in page content, metadata, or URLs to ensure SEO performance.

# Context Awareness
# When assisting, consider the current domain and language context provided by the developer.
# If unclear, ask: "Which domain/language are you working on (CZ, SK, DE, UK)?"
