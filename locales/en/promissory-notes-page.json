    "description": "A promissory note is a security and the basic type of its transfer is endorsement, indorsement, which enables a quick and simple transfer of rights arising from the promissory note. All promissory notes can be transferred by indorsement, except for recta promissory notes, i.e., promissory notes with the clause \"not to order\". The essence of the transfer by endorsement is that the current owner of the promissory note (remittent) marks an indorsement clause on the back of the promissory note or on its attachment and hands over the promissory note to the new owner (indorsee), who thereby acquires all rights from the promissory note that are the content of the transferred promissory note.",

      "If the promissory note is in the name with the clause \"not to order\", it can only be transferred by cession, i.e., by assignment of the receivable by contract according to § 1879 et seq. of Act No. 89/2012 Coll., Civil Code, as amended. The assignee (the one who acquires the promissory note) enters, based on the contract on assignment of the receivable, into all rights of the assignor (the one who assigns the promissory note) associated with the receivable, i.e., there is not only a transfer of rights from the promissory note as in the case of endorsement. The purchase of a promissory note is therefore realized on the basis of a contract on assignment of a receivable.",
      "The price (consideration, contractual fee) ranges from 50 to 80 percent of the nominal value of the purchase object and depends on the nominal value of the receivable or promissory note and their quality. It is determined individually and is definitively set in the contract proposal. If the assignment of the promissory note was negotiated for a consideration, the assignor is liable to the assignee up to the amount of the received consideration with interest for the fact that the receivable existed at the time of assignment, and according to the agreement with the assignee, may also guarantee its collectibility.",
      "In case of agreement on payment of the assignee's cash expenses, purposefully incurred in connection with the provision of legal services, especially for court and other fees, travel expenses, postage, telecommunication fees, expert opinions and professional statements, translations, transcripts and photocopies, associated with the collection of the receivable by extrajudicial and judicial means, the complexity and factual and legal complexity of the matter, time requirements and the assignor's demands for handling the matter, as well as the debtor's creditworthiness are taken into account."
